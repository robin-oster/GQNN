== Description ==

### WindPress: the only Tailwind CSS v3 and v4 integration plugin for WordPress.

WindPress is a platform agnostic [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) integration plugin for WordPress that allows you to use the full power of Tailwind CSS within the WordPress ecosystem.

**Tailwind CSS version**:
- 3.4.17
- 4.1.11

### Features

WindPress is packed full of features designed to streamline your workflow. Some of our favorites are:

* **Dual Tailwind CSS version**: Tailwind CSS `3.x` and `4.x` ready.
* **Plug and play**: Start using Tailwind CSS in WordPress in seconds — no setup is required.
* **Customizable Configuration**: The plugin comes with a default Tailwind CSS configuration, but you can easily customize it to fit your needs.
* **Easy to use**: Simplified and intuitive settings to get you up and running quickly.
* **Lightweight**: The plugin dashboard built on top of WordPress REST API, and a modern JavaScript framework for an instant, responsive user experience. Yet it has a small footprint and won't slow down your site.
* **Blazingly fast**: Cache makes your WordPress site blazing fast. Generate the final optimized CSS file in the browser without server-side tools. None of your data is transferred over the network.

And some specific integrations also include the following features:

* **Autocompletion**: As you type, Tailwind CSS class names will be suggested automatically.
* **Variable Picker**: Easily select Tailwind CSS themes' colors, fonts, and other variables from a panel.
* **HTML to native elements**: Convert Tailwind CSS HTML to native elements in the editor.
* **Sort the classes**: Sort the Tailwind CSS classes on the input field.
* **Hover Preview the classes**: Hover over the classes to see the complete outputted CSS and the preview of the design canvas.
* **Ubiquitous Panel**: A floating panel that allows you to quickly access the WindPress settings from anywhere on the page.
